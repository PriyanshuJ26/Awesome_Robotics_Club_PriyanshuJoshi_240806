I’m excited to join two projects: Autonomous Navigation and the Mechanical Turk. The Autonomous Navigation project offers a great opportunity for me to apply my knowledge in practical world, particularly in areas like obstacle avoidance, path planning, and SLAM. I’m eager to work in a team where we can experiment, prototype, and learn from the challenges of building autonomous systems in real-time.
At the same time, I’m also interested in the Mechanical Turk project. Building a robot that plays chess involves tackling real engineering challenges, including movement precision, object recognition, and decision-making algorithms. The opportunity to work on these projects will allow me to enhance my problem-solving skills, collaborate effectively in a team, and grow as an engineer.
Joining both projects will not only help me apply my technical knowledge but also give me the chance to improve teamwork, adapt to challenges, and push the boundaries of what I can achieve.
